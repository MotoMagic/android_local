Android Local Manifests
=======================

This repo holds a bunch of XML files that represent local_manifest.xml files
that can be used to properly use the MotoMagic device repos within a desired
AOSP tree.

Basically take one of these files, rename it to "local_manifest.xml" and
place it in your ".repo" folder, then repo sync.
